Welcome to the script junkjard, look around maybe you find something useful!

This is just monorepo containing all of the small projects I'm working on, that don't need it's own repo but I still want to make available to others.

This is a launchpad for projects, so no guarantees that things will work, be maintained or that they won't blow up in your face, but by all means, help yourself!
