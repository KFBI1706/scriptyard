# Budged Discord Nitro

Being a poor student I can't afford discord nitro. So why not make a workaround?

This project is split up in two parts:
1. is basically just a bot that joins channels, and fetches their custom emojis, then making them available through an API
2. is a CLI client, which uses this API and fetches, converts and adds the image to the system clipboard.
3. BONUS vue frontend in typescript, just for fun

- [x] Make backend
- [ ] Make frontend
- [ ] Support for animated emojis
- [ ] Free CI, image builds, and release binary creation
